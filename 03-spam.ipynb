El problema radica en que los usuarios deben pagar por los mesajes recibidos, y por este motivo resulta muy importante que las compañías prestadoras del servicio puedan filtrar mensajes indeseados antes de enviarlos a su destinatario final. Los mensajes tienen una longitud máxima de 160 caracteres, por lo que el texto resulta poco para realizar la clasificación, en comparación con textos más largos (como los emails). Adicionalmente, los errores de digitación dificultan el proceso de detección automática."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CbkGYeeeVzKo","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Descripción del problema en términos de los datos"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vI-5EVmeVzKp","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Se tiene una muestra contiene 5574 mensajes en inglés, no codificados y clasificados como legítimos (ham) o spam (http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/).
